## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **React** (Functional Components)
* **JavaScript** (ES6+)
* **CSS** (Responsive and modern UI)

---

## 🧠 How It Works

* `useReducer` manages the todo state, including `inputValue` and an array of `tasks`.
* Tasks are added with a unique `id` using `Date.now()`.
* Each task can be updated inline or removed with a confirmation.
* CSS styling enhances usability and appearance.
